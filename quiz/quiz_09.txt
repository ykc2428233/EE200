Write your responses below the prompts.  Please don't delete any of the
existing text; you'll make the grader fail.  For multiple choice, just put an
'x' or some other character in the brackets.


1)  Why does the book say the recusive implementation of the Fibonacci function is slow?
(select one)
[x] Because the algorithm duplicates work
[ ] Because the recursive function calls take a lot of time
[ ] Because the Fibonacci function is hard to compute
[ ] Because most computers aren't optimized for recursive algorithms


2)  What language does one of the authors of the book particularly like?
(select one)
[ ] C/C++
[ ] Java
[ ] Python
[ ] Haskell
[x] SML


3)  What is important about tail recursion?
(select one)
[ ] Tail-recursive functions are faster than head-recursive ones.
[ ] Nothing happens in a tail recursive function, so it can be optimized out by the compiler.
[x] Tail-recursive functions can be transformed into while loops.
[ ] Animals have tails, too.


4)  What questions do you have about the material in this chapter?
(free response)
Would mutual recursions in the parser for a C compiler duplicate work?

5)  What concepts would you most like to review?
(free response)
Mutual Recursion.
