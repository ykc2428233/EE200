Write your responses below the prompts.  Please don't delete any of the
existing text; you'll make the grader fail.  For multiple choice, just put an
'x' or some other character in the brackets.


1)  If an executable program is run with no arguments, what are the contents of argv[0]?
(select one)
[ ] The name of the shell which launched the program
[x] The name of the program
[ ] An empty string
[ ] It doesn't exist; argv is a NULL pointer


2)  What does the book say is the difference between a system call and a library call?
(free response)
System call transfers control into the OS, requesting it to perform a task, library call calls a function found in a library.

3)  How can your code detect when a system call fails?
(select all that apply)
[x] By checking the variable `errno`
[x] By testing return values
[x] By reading from stderr
[ ] By examining the kernel log


4)  If my code opens a file with:

    FILE* f = fopen('quiz_07.txt', 'w+');

and the file exists, what happens?
(select one)
[ ] The function returns NULL
[ ] The file is opened, and its contents are available for reading and writing
[x] The file is opened for reading and writing, but existing text is erased
[ ] The file is opened for reading and writing, and writes add new text at the end


5)  Why does fgetc return an int, since its job is to return the next character from a file?
(select one)
[ ] The return value is an error code, and the character is passed with a pointer
[x] So that it can return a non-char value to indicate the end of a file
[ ] Because some file types (e.g, UTF-16) use more than 1 byte to represent a character
[ ] Because numeric values are returned as integers, rather than characters


6)  What questions do you have about the material in this chapter?
(free response)
Is is possible to change the value of arg[] in a program? 
Does fgetc get characters one by one?
What's the difference between the errno and the return values? 

7)  What concepts would you most like to review?
(free response)
Closing files and writing buffered data to disk.
